# Skyscanner Romanian (RO) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use **Romanian** — warm, friendly, conversational, not formal or stiff
- Address users with **informal singular "tu"** (not formal "dumneavoastră")
- Write as if talking to a friend — natural, clear, direct
- **Avoid nominalization:** Use verbs instead of excessive nouns to keep tone casual
- **Creativity is key:** Translate meaning, not words; make it sound naturally Romanian
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (keep in English, do not translate)

### 1.2. Punctuation

| Mark | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Ampersand (&) | Translate as "și" unless part of a brand name |
| Dash (—) | Use sparingly; primarily for pauses; can replace with comma or colon |
| Quotation marks | Use Romanian style: „..." for primary; « » for nested quotes |
| Exclamation (!) | Use sparingly — don't overuse |
| Comma (,) | Avoid excessive punctuation |

- **Do not use excessive punctuation** — it makes text harder to read
- Dash signs should not be overused outside of marking pauses

### 1.3. Numbers & Dates

| Context | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Date format | DD.MM.YYYY (14.04.2016) |
| Full date in text | joi, 14 aprilie 2016 (**lowercase** days/months) |
| Time format | 24-hour with colon (14:53) |
| Thousand separator | Full stop (1.000) |
| Decimal separator | Comma (3,5) |
| Numbers in text | Use digits (prefer "3 zile" over "trei zile") |
| Millions/billions | Use words: "3 miliarde" (not "3.000.000.000") |
| Ranges | Conversational: "între 2 și 7 zile" (not "2-7 zile") |

### 1.4. Currencies
- **Without number:** Write in letters (e.g., "cont în euro")
- **With number:** Use code format with space: `250 EUR`
- **Non-breaking space** between number and currency code
- **Avoid currency symbols** (€, $) in translations — use letter codes (EUR, USD)

### 1.5. Addressing Users – "Tu"
- Always use **informal "tu"** form (not "dumneavoastră")
- Maintains friendly, warm tone consistent with Skyscanner's voice
- Verb conjugations should match 2nd person singular informal

### 1.6. Anglicisms
- **Acceptable:** Widely understood English words (e.g., "online", "check-in", "email")
- **Avoid:** Niche English terms or jargon not widely known to general Romanian audience
- When in doubt, use Romanian equivalent if one exists and is natural

### 1.7. Names & Toponyms
- **Skyscanner:** Keep in English (never translate)
- **Brand/company names:** Keep in English unless established Romanian name exists
- **Country names:** Follow EU Publications Office Romanian conventions
- **URLs:** Always keep in English

### 1.8. Units of Measure
- Use **metric system** (km, m, kg, etc.)

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Quotation Mark Tolerance

Romanian has specific quotation mark conventions, but flexibility is needed.

#### 2.1.1. Acceptable Quotation Mark Styles

| Style | Example | Accept? |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Romanian standard | „exemplu" | ✓ Preferred |
| Guillemets (nested) | „text «citat» text" | ✓ Preferred for nested |
| Straight double quotes | "exemplu" | ✓ Accept (system limitations) |
| English curly quotes | "exemplu" | ✓ Accept (minor) |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Straight quotes when Romanian quotes may not be available in system
- Minor quotation style variations that don't affect meaning

**Only flag** if quotation marks are missing where required or create confusion.

---

### 2.2. Gender & Case Agreement Tolerance

Romanian has grammatical gender and complex case system. For unknown-gender placeholders, **accept reasonable defaults.**

#### 2.2.1. Acceptable Gender Strategies

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Masculine default for unknown users | "Bun venit, {{user}}!" |
| Restructuring to avoid gender | Using impersonal constructions |
| Generic forms | Using constructions that work for both genders |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Masculine default for unknown-gender placeholders
- Restructuring to avoid gender specification
- Case variations when placeholder position makes exact case unpredictable

**Only flag** if gender/case is **explicitly specified** in context and translation contradicts it.

---

### 2.3. Meaning-Based Translation Tolerance

The Style Guide encourages natural, conversational translation that sounds originally Romanian.

#### 2.3.1. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"
- Restructured sentences that preserve meaning
- Idiomatic adaptations appropriate for Romanian
- Simplification of complex English structures
- Natural Romanian word order (which may differ from English)
- Reduced nominalization (verbs used instead of noun constructions)

#### 2.3.2. Do NOT Flag as "Omission/Addition"
- Removal of excessive exclamation marks (English → Romanian tone adjustment)
- Adjustment of articles for natural Romanian flow
- Definite article placement variations (enclitic article handling)
- Addition of elements required for grammatical Romanian

**Only flag** if core meaning is changed or lost.

---

### 2.4. Punctuation & Formatting Tolerance

#### 2.4.1. Do NOT Flag
- Romanian quotation marks („") vs. straight quotes ("")
- Minor dash usage variations (em dash vs. en dash for pauses)
- Removal of exclamation marks when they sound unnatural in Romanian
- Replacement of dashes with commas or colons for clarity
- Minor comma placement variations for natural flow

#### 2.4.2. Only Flag If
- Question becomes statement (? removed from question)
- Punctuation creates meaning confusion
- Excessive punctuation that impairs readability

---

### 2.5. Number & Date Format Tolerance

#### 2.5.1. Do NOT Flag
- Minor variations in date separator (14.04.2016 vs. 14/04/2016) if consistent
- Written-out small numbers OR digits, unless inconsistent within same text
- Conversational ranges ("între 2 și 7") OR hyphenated ranges ("2-7") for space constraints
- "3 milioane" vs. "3.000.000" for large round numbers

#### 2.5.2. Only Flag If
- Thousands/decimal separators are wrong (comma for thousands, period for decimals = WRONG)
- Date format is clearly incorrect or confusing
- Capitalized days/months in running text (Joi, Aprilie = WRONG)

---

### 2.6. Currency Format Tolerance

#### 2.6.1. Do NOT Flag
- "250 EUR" format (preferred)
- "250 de euro" in conversational text
- Minor spacing variations around currency codes

#### 2.6.2. Only Flag If
- Currency symbol used where code should be (€250 in body text)
- Wrong currency code
- Missing space between number and currency code in formal contexts

---

### 2.7. Terminology & Synonym Tolerance

| English | Acceptable Romanian Options |
|---------|----------------------------|
| Flight | zbor, cursă aeriană |
| Book (verb) | rezerva, a face o rezervare |
| Search | căuta, a efectua o căutare |
| Deal | ofertă, promoție |

| Hotel | hotel |
| Save (money) | economisi, a face economii |

**Do NOT flag** reasonable synonym choices unless they change meaning.

---

### 2.8. Anglicism Tolerance

#### 2.8.1. Do NOT Flag
- Widely understood English terms: "online", "check-in", "email", "site", "link", "app"
- Technical terms without good Romanian equivalents
- Brand names and product names kept in English

#### 2.8.2. Only Flag If
- Niche jargon that general audience wouldn't understand
- English term used when natural Romanian equivalent exists AND is clearly better
- Inconsistent use of anglicism vs. Romanian equivalent in same text

---

### 2.9. Formality & Register Tolerance

#### 2.9.1. Do NOT Flag
- Use of "tu" form throughout (this is CORRECT per style guide)
- Conversational, casual phrasing
- Reduced nominalization (verbs over noun constructions)
- Informal expressions appropriate for friendly tone

#### 2.9.2. Only Flag If
- Mixed formality ("tu" and "dumneavoastră" in same context)
- Overly formal/bureaucratic tone inappropriate for Skyscanner voice
- Register clearly wrong for content type (e.g., too casual for legal content)

---

### 2.10. Definite Article & Case Tolerance

Romanian uses enclitic (suffixed) definite articles and has complex case declension.

#### 2.10.1. Do NOT Flag
- Appropriate case choice for sentence structure (even if different from literal source)
- Article placement following Romanian grammar rules
- Restructuring to handle case agreement with placeholders

#### 2.10.2. Only Flag If
- Incorrect case that creates grammatical error
- Missing or wrong article that affects meaning

---

### 2.11. Severity Calibration

| Severity | Apply When |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Placeholder corruption, complete meaning inversion, broken tags, wrong currency |
| **Major** | Core meaning changed, factual errors, wrong formality level for content type |
| **Minor** | Style preferences, minor inconsistencies within acceptable range |
| **Do Not Flag** | Issues covered by tolerance rules 2.1–2.10 |

---

### 2.12. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is this a **natural restructuring** for Romanian grammar and flow?
2. ☐ Is the **informal "tu" register** correctly maintained?
3. ☐ Is the **core meaning preserved** despite structural changes?
4. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
5. ☐ Would a native Romanian speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different)?
6. ☐ Is this an **acceptable anglicism** widely understood in Romania?
7. ☐ Are **quotation marks** functional even if not ideal Romanian style?

**If meaning is preserved AND the structure sounds natural in Romanian → DO NOT FLAG**
