## 5. LQA CALIBRATION: ANTI-FALSE POSITIVE GUIDELINES
**IMPORTANT:** The AI Evaluator must use the following rules to **IGNORE** potential errors. These patterns represent acceptable stylistic variations or natural elaborations in Simplified Chinese. **Do NOT report** issues falling under these categories.

### 5.1. Acceptable Synonymy & Variation
Do not flag a translation as an error if the Target conveys the same functional meaning as the Source, even if a different word is used.
- **Search/Find:** "Search", "Find", "Look for" can be translated as `搜索`, `查找`, `寻找`, or `找`. All are acceptable unless the glossary mandates one specific term for a UI Button.
- **Book/Order:** "Book" can be `预订` or `订购`.
- **Price/Fare:** "Price", "Fare", "Cost" can be `价格`, `费用`, or `金额`.
- **Offers/Deals:** In quantitative lists (e.g., "5 deals"), `5个结果` (5 results) or `5个价格` (5 prices) are acceptable synonyms for `5个优惠` (5 deals). Do not flag this as a mistranslation.

### 5.2. Semantic Elaboration (Explicit Nouns)
Chinese often requires a "Head Noun" to make a phrase sound natural. Do not flag the addition of generic helper nouns as "Additions" or "Terminology Errors".
- **Rule:** Target = [Source Concept] + [Generic Helper Noun].
- **Examples to IGNORE (Do not flag):**
  - Source: "Car hire" -> Target: `租车服务` (Car hire **service**). *Acceptable.*
  - Source: "Flight info" -> Target: `航班信息` (**Information**). *Acceptable.*
  - Source: "Privacy" -> Target: `隐私政策` (Privacy **Policy**). *Acceptable.*
  - Source: "Guide" -> Target: `旅游指南` (Travel **guide**). *Acceptable.*

### 5.3. Structural & Syntactic Flexibility
Do not flag changes in sentence structure if they improve flow in Chinese.
- **Parentheses Usage:** If the translator moves a descriptive clause into parentheses (or vice versa) to make the sentence readable, do NOT flag this as a Style/Grammar error.
  - *Example:* Source "Flights from London" -> Target `航班 (从伦敦出发)` is **Acceptable**.
- **Active vs. Passive:** "Your flight was saved" -> `您已保存航班` (You saved the flight). This shift to Active voice is preferred in Chinese. **Do NOT flag.**
- **Word Order:** Chinese places time/location before the verb. Do not flag reordering.

### 5.4. Contextual Terminology Leniency
While the Glossary (TB) is important, context dictates usage.
- **"Deal" in UI:** If the source says "{{number}} deals", and the target says `{{number}} 个结果` (results) or `{{number}} 起` (starting from), **Do NOT flag**. This is a standard UI pattern to avoid over-promising "discounts" when displaying general search results.
- **"Cheap" vs "Value":** If the source says "Cheapest" and the target says `最划算` (Best value) or `超值` (Super value), allow this in Marketing contexts. Only flag if it creates a factual lie (e.g., calling an expensive item "cheap").

### 5.5. Punctuation Nuances
- **Trailing Periods:** If a UI header is a complete sentence in Chinese context, a trailing period is sometimes omitted or added for visual balance. Unless it looks visibly broken, **downgrade or ignore** punctuation flags in standalone headers.
- **Space around Placeholders:** Do not flag the presence (or absence) of a space around `{{variable}}` unless it causes words to merge illegibly.

### 5.6. Tone/Register False Positives
- **"Please":** The addition or removal of `请` (Please) is often a localization choice. Do not flag unless it makes the tone rude.
- **"We":** Changing "Skyscanner" to `我们` (We) or vice versa is a valid localization technique. **Do NOT flag.**
