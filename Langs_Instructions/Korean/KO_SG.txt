## 7. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION GUIDELINES

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** The following rules define what the LQA Evaluator must **IGNORE or ACCEPT**. These patterns represent acceptable variations, standard Korean localization practices, or minor stylistic differences that do NOT warrant flagging. Flagging these will be considered an evaluator error.

---

### 7.1. Speech Level & Tone Tolerance

The style guide expresses **preferences**, not absolute requirements. Apply these tolerance rules:

#### 7.1.1. Acceptable Sentence Endings by Context
| Context | Acceptable Endings | Do NOT Flag |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Buttons/CTAs** | `~하기`, `~하세요`, noun forms (`검색`, `예약`) | Any of these variations |
| **Headlines/Headers** | `~(하)세요`, `~하기`, noun phrases | Noun-ending forms in headlines |
| **Subheaders** | `~(하)세요`, `~요`, `~니다` | `~니다` if the content is informative rather than promotional |
| **Push Notifications** | `~요`, `~세요`, `~니다` | Any polite/formal ending |
| **Legal/Policy/System Messages** | `~니다`, `~습니다` | Formal endings are EXPECTED here |
| **Confirmations/Notifications** | `~되었습니다`, `~완료되었습니다` | Formal completive forms |

#### 7.1.2. Connector Formality
- `~하여` and `~해` are **interchangeable**. Do NOT flag one as "too formal" vs the other.
- `~(으)며` and `~고` are both acceptable conjunctions.

#### 7.1.3. When to Flag Tone Issues
Only flag tone/register if:
- The text is **inconsistent within the same segment** (mixing `~요` and `~니다` awkwardly)
- The tone is **inappropriate for context** (e.g., casual slang in legal text, or stiff formal language in playful marketing with emojis)
- The formality level **actively harms comprehension or brand voice**

---

### 7.2. "You" (여러분/당신) Usage Tolerance

#### 7.2.1. Do NOT Flag
- **Inclusion** of `여러분이` or `여러분의` even when omittable — this is a stylistic choice, not an error
- **Omission** of "you/your" when context makes the subject clear
- Use of `여러분` in marketing content for warmth

#### 7.2.2. Only Flag If
- `귀하` is used (explicitly prohibited)
- The subject becomes genuinely ambiguous without "you"
- `당신` is used outside inspirational/poetic marketing contexts

---

### 7.3. Company & Airline Name Handling

#### 7.3.1. Transliteration is Acceptable
Korean transliteration of foreign company/airline names is **standard localization practice**. Do NOT flag:
- `Gum Air` → `검에어(Gum Air)` ✓
- `St Barth Executive` → `세인트바스이그제큐티브(St Barth Executive)` ✓
- `Sunclass Airlines` → `선클래스항공(Sunclass Airlines)` ✓

#### 7.3.2. Both Formats Acceptable
The following are **equally valid**:
- Korean transliteration with English in parentheses: `검에어(Gum Air)`
- English only: `Gum Air`
- Korean only (if commonly known): `대한항공`

#### 7.3.3. Only Flag If
- The transliteration violates 외래어 표기법 orthography rules
- A well-known official Korean name exists but wasn't used (e.g., `Korean Air` should be `대한항공`)
- The name is corrupted or misspelled

---

### 7.4. Term Variation Tolerance

#### 7.4.1. Acceptable Synonyms (Do NOT Flag as "Term Inconsistency")
| English | All Acceptable Korean Options |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Flights | `항공권`, `항공편` (both valid in different contexts) |
| Book | `예약하다`, `예매하다` |
| Search | `검색`, `조회`, `찾기` |
| Options | `옵션`, `선택지`, contextual equivalents (e.g., `열차편` for "rail options") |
| Deal | `특가`, `상품`, `특가 상품` |
| Budget (hotels) | `저가`, `알뜰`, `저렴한` |
| Bus station | `버스 터미널`, `버스 정류장` (context-dependent) |
| Exclusive | `단독`, `독점`, `특별` |
| Room | `객실`, `방` |
| Pick-up | `대여`, `인수`, `픽업` |

#### 7.4.2. Only Flag Terminology If
- The term **contradicts explicit TB (Termbase) entries** AND causes meaning change
- The term creates **factual inaccuracy** (e.g., "outbound" translated as "inbound")
- A **product name** is mistranslated (e.g., "Explore" feature name omitted)

---

### 7.5. Minor Elaboration & Naturalization Tolerance

#### 7.5.1. Acceptable Additions (Do NOT Flag as "Addition")
- Adding `상품` or `서비스` to make nouns natural: `Car hire` → `렌터카 상품` ✓
- Adding brand name for clarity in standalone strings where context is ambiguous
- Adding particles or postpositions required by Korean grammar

#### 7.5.2. Acceptable Omissions (Do NOT Flag as "Omission")
- Omitting "you/your" when subject is contextually clear
- Omitting redundant words that would sound unnatural if literally translated
- Condensing repetitive phrasing for natural Korean flow

#### 7.5.3. Only Flag Additions/Omissions If
- **Key meaning is changed** (e.g., adding "lowest" when source says "great")
- **Product/feature names** are omitted
- **Numerical values or superlatives** are added without source support
- **Scope is restricted** (e.g., "compare and book" becomes only "book")

---

### 7.6. Stylistic "Improvement" Tolerance

Do NOT flag translations as errors when the issue is merely a **possible improvement** rather than a mistake:

#### 7.6.1. Do NOT Flag
- "Unnatural" if the translation is **grammatically correct and comprehensible**
- Minor word order preferences that don't affect meaning
- Stylistic choices in metaphor/idiom translation (e.g., "soul" → "심장" vs "영혼" — both convey the metaphor)
- Redundancy that doesn't harm comprehension

#### 7.6.2. Only Flag Style Issues If
- The translation is **grammatically incorrect**
- The phrasing creates **ambiguity or confusion**
- The style is **grossly inappropriate** for the content type

---

### 7.7. Severity Calibration Rules

Apply these severity thresholds strictly:

#### 7.7.1. CRITICAL (Must Always Flag)
- Placeholder corruption/truncation (e.g., `{lowest_price_l` instead of `{lowest_price_all}`)
- Tag/HTML entity errors (e.g., `&amp;` rendered literally)
- Complete meaning inversion

#### 7.7.2. MAJOR (Flag Only If)
- Factual meaning is changed (superlatives added/removed, numbers wrong)
- Key product/feature names omitted
- Content misaligned across segments
- Logical errors (direction inversion, temporal logic errors)
- Scope restriction that changes what users can do

#### 7.7.3. MINOR (Flag Conservatively)
- TB term preferences where both options are valid Korean
- Style preferences within acceptable range
- Minor omissions of non-essential descriptors

#### 7.7.4. DO NOT FLAG (Suppress)
- Tone/formality variations within acceptable ranges (see 7.1)
- Acceptable synonym usage (see 7.4)
- Company name transliteration choices (see 7.3)
- Minor stylistic preferences

---

### 7.8. Duplicate Content Handling

- If the **same source text appears in multiple segments**, do NOT flag identical issues multiple times
- Reference the first occurrence and note "Same issue as Segment [ID]" for subsequent instances
- This reduces reviewer workload and avoids redundant validation

---

### 7.9. Critical Logic Checks (MUST Flag)

Despite the tolerance rules above, **ALWAYS flag** these issues regardless of context:

| Issue Type | Example | Why Critical |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Directional Inversion** | "From Seoul" → "서울행" (should be "서울발/출발") | Booking error risk |
| **Temporal Logic Error** | "Cancel up to 24h before" → "24시간 후 취소" | Policy misrepresentation |
| **Numerical Error** | "1000's" → "약 1,000개" (thousands vs ~1,000) | Factual misrepresentation |
| **Price Modifier Addition** | Adding `최저가`, `단돈` next to `{{price}}` | False advertising risk |
| **Superlative Addition** | "Great prices" → "최저가" (great ≠ lowest) | Legal/trust risk |
| **Product Name Omission** | "Explore shows..." → feature name "Explore" missing | Feature identification failure |
| **Placeholder Mismatch** | Any corruption, truncation, or wrong placeholder name | Functional breakage |
| **Content Misalignment** | Translated content doesn't match source in split segments | Display errors |

---

### 7.10. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging ANY issue, the evaluator must confirm:

1. ☐ Is this a **genuine error** or merely a **stylistic preference**?
2. ☐ Does this issue **change meaning** or just wording?
3. ☐ Is the translation **grammatically incorrect** or just different from my preference?
4. ☐ Would a native Korean speaker find this **confusing or wrong**, or just "not how I'd phrase it"?
5. ☐ Is this covered by the **tolerance rules above**?

**If the answer to questions 1-4 suggests "preference" rather than "error," and question 5 indicates tolerance applies → DO NOT FLAG.**
