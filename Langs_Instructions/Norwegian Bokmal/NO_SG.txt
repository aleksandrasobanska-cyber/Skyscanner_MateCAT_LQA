# Skyscanner Norwegian Bokmål (NB) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- **Imagine talking to a friend** — say what you mean and say it clearly
- **Boil down sentences to their essence** — recreate meaning in the simplest way possible
- **Be brief:**
  - Long sentences? Break them up
  - Too many words? Get rid of some
  - Long words? Use shorter ones
- Use **active voice** as much as possible
- **Be interesting but not over-enthusiastic** — use strong adjectives and active verbs
- **Avoid too many exclamation marks**
- **Avoid industry jargon** and business speak — don't assume people know terminology
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (keep in English)

### 1.2. Punctuation
| Mark | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Period (.) | End of sentences |
| Comma (,) | Between clauses |
| Quotation marks | **« »** (guillemets) — NOT " " |
| Exclamation mark (!) | Use sparingly — avoid overuse |

### 1.3. Non-Breaking Spaces (harde mellomrom)
Use non-breaking spaces according to official Norwegian guidelines:
- Between **number and currency:** 100 kr, 50 €
- Between **number and percentage symbol:** 25 %
- Between **number and unit:** 5 km, 30 min

### 1.4. Numbers & Formatting
- Follow Norwegian conventions for number formatting
- **Decimal separator:** comma (1,5)
- **Thousand separator:** space or period (1 000 or 1.000)
- Reference Språkrådet for specific conventions

### 1.5. Possessives (Eiendomspronomen)
English uses possessives more frequently than Norwegian. **Question whether possessive is necessary.**

**Normal placement:** AFTER the word it modifies
- ✅ "Hvor finner jeg bestillingen min?"
- ❌ "Hvor finner jeg min bestilling?"

**Exception:** Place BEFORE when indicating explicit contrast
- "Dette er *din* sykkel" (contrasting with other bikes)

### 1.6. Use of "Free" / "Gratis"
**IMPORTANT: Norwegian legal restriction**

According to Norwegian law (Regulation of Unreasonable Commercial Practice, §1-20):
> "Free", "free of charge", and similar expressions may not be used in marketing if the free service is conditional on the purchase of other benefits.

**Required workarounds:**
| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| gratis | uten tilleggskostnader |
| kostnadsfri | inkludert tilleggstjenester |
| free | uten ekstra kostnad |

### 1.7. Anglicisms
Use the most widely known term in Norwegian. If it's an established anglicism, it's acceptable. However, **prefer Norwegian alternatives when available:**

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| online | tilkoblet, på nettet, tilgjengelig |
| sjekke | se nærmere på, ta en titt på, undersøke, besøke, se, kontrollere, gå gjennom |
| matche | svarer til, er lik, tilsvarer, passe sammen med, stemme overens (med) |

### 1.8. Transcreation & Natural Norwegian
- Use **simple, clear Norwegian sentence structures**
- **Avoid literal translations**
- **Avoid translating "will" as "vil"** — use present tense instead:
  - ❌ "Vi vil kontakte deg"
  - ✅ "Vi kontakter deg"

### 1.9. Privacy & Data Protection Content
- Reference the **official Norwegian translation of the GDPR**
- Use established terminology from official sources

### 1.10. Reference Sources
- **Språkrådet** (Language Council of Norway): www.sprakradet.no
- **Bokmålsordboka**: ordbok.uib.no
- **Det norske akademis ordbok**: naob.no

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Transcreation & Simplification Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly encourages boiling down sentences to their essence. **Accept significant restructuring that preserves meaning.**

#### 2.1.1. Acceptable Transcreation Approaches

| Source | Acceptable Norwegian Approaches |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `We will contact you` | `Vi kontakter deg` (present tense, NOT "Vi vil kontakte deg") |
| `You will receive an email` | `Du får en e-post` OR `Du mottar en e-post` |
| `Your booking has been confirmed` | `Bestillingen er bekreftet` OR `Bestillingen din er bekreftet` |
| `Check out our latest deals` | `Se våre siste tilbud` OR `Ta en titt på de nyeste tilbudene` |
| `This feature allows you to...` | `Med denne funksjonen kan du...` OR `Her kan du...` |

**Do NOT flag** if the translator:
- Simplifies complex sentence structures
- Breaks long sentences into shorter ones
- Uses shorter words with equivalent meaning
- Removes unnecessary words while preserving meaning
- Uses present tense instead of "vil + infinitive"

#### 2.1.2. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"
- Simplified sentences that preserve core meaning
- Restructured sentences using natural Norwegian word order
- Condensed phrasing that eliminates redundancy
- Active voice replacing passive voice

**Only flag** if core meaning is changed or lost.

---

### 2.2. Possessive Placement Tolerance

Norwegian possessive placement differs from English. **Accept Norwegian-standard placement.**

#### 2.2.1. Acceptable Possessive Approaches

| Source | Acceptable Norwegian |
|--------|---------------------|
| `your booking` | `bestillingen din` (possessive AFTER — standard) |
| `my account` | `kontoen min` (possessive AFTER — standard) |
| `your trip` | `reisen din` OR `turen din` |
| `Check your email` | `Sjekk e-posten din` OR `Sjekk e-posten` (possessive omitted) |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Possessive placed AFTER noun (standard Norwegian)
- Possessive omitted when meaning is clear from context
- Possessive placed BEFORE noun when indicating contrast

**Only flag** if possessive placement creates ambiguity or unnatural phrasing.

---

### 2.3. "Free" / "Gratis" Handling Tolerance

Due to Norwegian legal restrictions, translators must avoid "gratis" in certain contexts.

#### 2.3.1. Acceptable Workarounds for "Free"

| Source | Acceptable Norwegian Approaches |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `Free cancellation` | `Avbestilling uten tilleggskostnad` OR `Gratis avbestilling` (if truly free) |
| `Free service included` | `Inkludert tilleggstjenester` OR `Uten ekstra kostnad` |
| `Book for free` | `Bestill uten tilleggskostnader` |

**Do NOT flag:**
- "Gratis" replaced with "uten tilleggskostnader" or similar
- "Kostnadsfri" replaced with "inkludert" constructions
- Creative workarounds that avoid legal issues while preserving meaning

**Only flag** if the workaround changes the core meaning OR if "gratis" is used where it may violate Norwegian marketing law.

| matche | svarer til, er lik, tilsvarer, passe sammen med, stemme overens med |
