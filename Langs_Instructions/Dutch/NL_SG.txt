2. General Writing & Translation Guidelines
2.1. What is Good Writing?
 • Always put the traveller first.
 • Avoid excessive adjectives.
 • Ensure every sentence is helpful.
 • Focus on user benefit and advice.
 • Pro tip: Always consider the user’s perspective.
2.2. Writing & Translation Guidelines
 • Make translations conversational; avoid formal, stiff, unnatural language.
 • Ensure translations are clear and use the most well-known terms.
 • If in doubt, translate the meaning, not the exact word.
 • Keep it simple: Use simple words, short sentences, and avoid unnecessary verbs.
 • Use active voice, especially in headlines and CTAs.
  - In Dutch, use the infinitive for buttons, CTAs, and titles.
   - Example:
   - Source: Sign up now.
   - WRONG: Meld je nu aan.
   - RIGHT: Nu aanmelden.
 • Address the reader directly using informal ‘jij, je’. For groups, use ‘jullie’ consistently.
 • Be specific: Provide concrete, actionable information.
  - Example: “The hotel is a mile’s walk (with lots of steps, be prepared if you’ve got kids) from the train station.”
 • Write as if talking to a friend; keep language natural and clear.
 • Make it personal: Use personal experience and vivid details.
  - Example: “The restaurant fuses Italian and Californian flavors. Their short rib with gnocchi is one of the best things I’ve ever tasted: really smoky and rich.”
 • Be interesting: Avoid making travel sound boring.
  - Example: “The museum is awesome — I saw a collection of real-life shrunken heads.”
 • Be honest: Disclose potential drawbacks.
  - Example: “This BBQ restaurant is one of the best in the city. Not so many options for vegetarians though.”
  - Example: “This is one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed in — but it’s also one of the most expensive.”
 • Check all details: Spellings, opening times, locations, historical details.
 • Use exclamation marks sparingly; only when it makes sense.
  - Example: ‘Gefeliciteerd!’ is appropriate, but ‘We hebben een leuke aanbieding voor je.’ does not need an exclamation mark.
3. Language-Specific Translation Guidelines
3.1. Punctuation & Spacing
 • Use punctuation to aid readability.
 • Avoid excess punctuation.
 • Follow Dutch language rules (see www.onzetaal.nl).
3.2. Addressing Users – YOU
 • Always use informal ‘je, jij, jullie’.
 • Never use ‘u’.
3.3. Formats (Numbers, Dates, Currencies, etc.)
3.3.1. Numbers, Dates, and Time
 • Write out numbers up to and including 10 in full, even if the source does not.
 • Use day/month/year format for dates.
 • Write out the month in full where possible.
  - Example: 3 mei 2020 (not 03/05/2020).
3.3.2. Currencies
 • Place currency symbols before the amount, followed by a space.
  - Example: $ 200, £ 150
 • Do not convert amounts to euros unless specified; follow the source.
3.3.3. Units of Measure
 • Convert English units to Dutch equivalents.
3.3.4. URL Translation Requirements
 • No spaces; only hyphens allowed.
  - Example: Write "citybreak", NOT "city break".
 • All characters in lowercase.
  - Example: Write "city-break", NOT "City-break".
 • No extended or special characters.
  - Example: Write e, o, NOT é, ö.
 • Only Latin characters allowed.
 • For languages with non-Latin alphabets, leave URLs in English (exception: EL uses transliteration).
  - Example: EN: airport-transfers → EL: metafores-aerodromiou
 • Use http://www.url-encode-decode.com/ to check special character usage.
 • If URLs are split into multiple strings, reverse the order in translation if there is an established translation.
  - Example: Source: city-breaks → CA: escapades-urbanes
 • If the established translation is more than two words, split so each part is meaningful.
