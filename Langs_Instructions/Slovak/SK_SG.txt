# Skyscanner Slovak (SK) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use **Slovak** — natural, friendly, but with formal address
- Address users with **formal "Vy"** (not informal "ty")
- **Capitalize "V"** in personalized emails/messages (e.g., "máme pre Vás")
- Write naturally — creative translation, not word-for-word
- **Creativity is encouraged:** Add, omit, rephrase to make translation feel natural
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (declined as Slovak word — see 1.2)

### 1.2. Brand Name Declension

Skyscanner should be **declined as a Slovak word** in UI and marketing content:

| Case | Form |
|------|------|
| Nominatív (N) | Skyscanner |
| Genitív (G) | Skyscannera |
| Datív (D) | Skyscanneru |
| Akuzatív (A) | Skyscanner |
| Lokál (L) | Skyscanneri |
| Inštrumentál (I) | Skyscannerom |

- **UI/short strings:** Use declined forms
- **Legal/formal content:** Use brand name with descriptor (e.g., "spoločnosť Skyscanner")

### 1.3. Punctuation

| Element | Punctuation Rule |
|---------|------------------|
| Titles, headings | No full stop (unless multiple sentences) |
| Email subjects | No full stop |
| Buttons, CTAs | No full stop |
| UI elements | No full stop |
| Multi-sentence headings | Use full stops |
| Exclamation marks | Use sparingly |

- **Not obligated to follow source punctuation**
- If translation is a fragment → no full stop needed
- If translation is a sentence → use full stop
- **Don't follow English comma usage blindly** — apply Slovak rules

### 1.4. Gender & Plural Handling

#### Gender with Formal "Vy"
- Formal "Vy" reduces gender issues
- When gender distinction needed, use: `Prečítal (-a) som si` or `spokojný (-á)`

#### Slovak Plural Complexity
Slovak has different forms for different number ranges:

| Count | Example |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | 1 dospelý |
| 2–4 | 2 dospelí, 3 dospelé osoby |
| 5+ | 5 dospelých, 10 dospelých osôb |

- **No smart count rule** — must account for all possibilities
- **Use workarounds:** Choose words that work for all number forms (e.g., "dospelí" works for both "dvaja dospelí" and "piati dospelí")

### 1.5. Placeholders & Descriptors

- Placeholder content inserts in **nominative case**
- Restructure sentences so placeholder can be in nominative
- Use **descriptors** when case agreement is impossible
- **Airport codes:** Descriptor not necessary (e.g., "Let z [code] do [code]" is acceptable)
- Keep translations **as short as possible**

### 1.6. Numbers & Formatting

| Context | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Thousands separator | Space (1 000) |
| Decimal separator | Comma (3,5) |
| Date format | DD. MM. YYYY or DD.MM.YYYY |
| Time format | 24-hour (14:53) |

### 1.7. Cultural Adaptation
- Cultural references, locations, names **can be adapted** to Slovak reality
- Only adapt if examples won't have accompanying visuals

### 1.8. Hyperlinks
- Should catch reader's eye
- Use **at least two words** for hyperlink text where possible

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Brand Name Declension Tolerance

#### 2.1.1. Acceptable Brand Name Forms

| Context | Acceptable Forms |
|---------|------------------|
| UI/Marketing | Skyscannera, Skyscanneru, Skyscanneri, Skyscannerom |
| Legal/Formal | "spoločnosť Skyscanner", "Skyscanner Limited" |
| Mixed context | Either declined or with descriptor |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Properly declined forms of Skyscanner
- Use of descriptor in formal contexts
- Nominative "Skyscanner" where grammatically appropriate

**Only flag** if declension is incorrect (wrong case ending) or inconsistent within same content type.

---

### 2.2. Formal Address ("Vy") Tolerance

#### 2.2.1. Acceptable Formal Address Patterns

| Context | Acceptable |
|---------|------------|
| General UI | "Vy", "Vás", "Vám", "Váš" (capitalized) |
| Personalized emails | Capital "V" required: "máme pre Vás" |
| General instructions | Lowercase acceptable in some contexts |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Consistent use of formal "Vy" address
- Capitalized "V" in direct address
- Lowercase "v" in non-personalized, general contexts (minor)

**Only flag** if:
- Informal "ty" used (should be formal "Vy")
- Mixed formality in same context (ty/Vy)
- Missing capital "V" in clearly personalized message

---

### 2.3. Gender Agreement Tolerance

#### 2.3.1. Acceptable Gender Handling

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Parenthetical alternatives | "Prečítal (-a) som si", "spokojný (-á)" |
| Masculine default | For unknown-gender contexts |
| Gender-neutral restructuring | Using constructions that avoid gender |
| Formal "Vy" forms | Naturally reduce gender marking |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Masculine default for unknown-gender placeholders
- Parenthetical gender alternatives: `(-a)`, `(-á)`, `(-é)`
- Restructuring to avoid gender specification
- Formal "Vy" conjugations that are gender-neutral

**Only flag** if gender is explicitly specified in context and translation contradicts it.

---

### 2.4. Plural & Number Agreement Tolerance

Slovak has complex plural rules. **Accept creative solutions for number placeholders.**

#### 2.4.1. Acceptable Plural Strategies

| Source | Acceptable Slovak Approaches |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `{{0}} adults` | Word form that works for 2-4 AND 5+ (e.g., "dospelí") |
| `{{0}} nights` | `{{0}} nocí` OR restructured form |
| `{{0}} results` | `Počet výsledkov: {{0}}` OR `{{0}} výsledkov` |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Creative word choice to handle all plural forms
- Restructuring to avoid plural agreement issues
- Use of constructions like "počet" + genitive
- Singular form where translator anticipated specific number range

**Only flag** if plural form would be **incorrect for ALL possible values**.

---

### 2.5. Placeholder & Case Tolerance

Slovak requires case agreement, but placeholders insert in nominative.

#### 2.5.1. Acceptable Placeholder Handling

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Restructure for nominative | Rephrase so placeholder is subject |
| Use descriptor | "z letiska {{code}}" |
| Omit descriptor for codes | "Let z {{code}} do {{code}}" (airport codes) |
| Creative rephrasing | Any structure that makes grammatical sense |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Restructured sentences accommodating nominative placeholders
- Omitted descriptors for airport codes, flight numbers, etc.
- Creative rephrasing that maintains meaning
- Descriptor use when case agreement requires it

**Only flag** if placeholder handling creates grammatical error or meaning confusion.

---

### 2.6. Punctuation Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly states translators are **not obligated to follow source punctuation**.

#### 2.6.1. Do NOT Flag
- Full stop added to fragment that became sentence
- Full stop removed from sentence that became fragment
- No full stop on titles, headings, buttons, CTAs, UI elements
- Full stops in multi-sentence headings
- Different comma placement following Slovak rules
- Removal of excessive exclamation marks

#### 2.6.2. Only Flag If
- Question becomes statement (? removed from question)
- Punctuation creates meaning confusion
- Full stop on button/CTA (should not have one)
- Missing full stops in running text

---

### 2.7. Meaning-Based Translation Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly encourages **creative, non-literal translation**.

#### 2.7.1. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"
- Restructured sentences that preserve meaning
- Added or omitted words for natural flow
- Rephrased sentences for Slovak grammar
- Cultural concept adaptations
- Deviation from TM matches for more natural phrasing

#### 2.7.2. Do NOT Flag as "Omission/Addition"
- Words added for grammatical Slovak
- Words omitted that are implied
- Restructuring for natural expression
- Cultural adaptations of examples/locations

**Only flag** if core meaning is changed or lost.

---

### 2.8. Terminology & Synonym Tolerance

| English | Acceptable Slovak Options |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Flight | let, linka |
| Book (verb) | rezervovať, zarezervovať |
| Search | hľadať, vyhľadať, vyhľadávanie |
| Deal | ponuka, akcia, výhodná ponuka |
| Trip | cesta, výlet, dovolenka |
| Hotel | hotel, ubytovanie |
| Save (money) | ušetriť, šetriť |
| Save (bookmark) | uložiť |
| App | aplikácia, appka (informal) |

**Do NOT flag** reasonable synonym choices unless they change meaning.

---

### 2.9. TM & Glossary Deviation Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly states TM and glossary are **"good helpers but bad masters."**

#### 2.9.1. Do NOT Flag
- Deviation from TM match for more natural translation
- Different term than glossary if contextually better
- Ignoring legacy TM from previous vendor
- Creative solutions not matching TM exactly

#### 2.9.2. Only Flag If
- Key terminology inconsistency within same content
- Deviation creates factual error
- Core product terms translated incorrectly

---

### 2.10. Cultural Adaptation Tolerance

#### 2.10.1. Do NOT Flag
- Location examples adapted to Slovak equivalents
- Cultural references adapted to Slovak context
- Name examples adapted when no visual aids accompany them
- Measurement conversions to metric system

#### 2.10.2. Only Flag If
- Adaptation creates factual error
- Specific location/name that should remain unchanged is altered
- Cultural adaptation changes core meaning

---

### 2.11. Severity Calibration

| Severity | Apply When |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Placeholder corruption, complete meaning inversion, broken tags, wrong formal address throughout |
| **Major** | Core meaning changed, factual errors, incorrect case declension of brand name, wrong plural forms |
| **Minor** | Style preferences, minor inconsistencies within acceptable range |
| **Do Not Flag** | Issues covered by tolerance rules 2.1–2.10 |

---

### 2.12. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is this a **creative restructuring** for natural Slovak expression?
2. ☐ Is the **formal "Vy" address** consistently used?
3. ☐ Is the **brand name declension** correct for the case required?
4. ☐ Does the **plural form work** for likely number values?
5. ☐ Is the **core meaning preserved** despite structural changes?
6. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
7. ☐ Would a native Slovak speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different)?
8. ☐ Is this a valid **deviation from TM/glossary** for naturalness?

**If meaning is preserved AND the structure sounds natural in Slovak → DO NOT FLAG**
