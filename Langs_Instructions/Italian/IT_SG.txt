Skyscanner Italian Language LQA Instructions
1. Audience
 • Target users are highly connected, community-oriented, content-aware, and active online.
 • They are selective and attentive to detail; translations must capture and maintain their attention.
2. Punctuation
 • Use punctuation to clarify meaning and improve readability.
 • Semicolons: Use only in particularly long and complex sentences that could be simplified.
 • Exclamation/Question Marks: Never use more than one at a time.
 • Hyphens: Replace with parentheses or commas. Do not use parentheses in email subject lines.
 • Quotation Marks: Use double straight quotes (" ") for consistency.
 • Punctuation in Quotes: Place punctuation marks that are part of a dialogue or quote inside the quotation marks; always place the period outside.
 • Apostrophes/Accents: Do not use an accent instead of an apostrophe or vice versa. Use the straight apostrophe, not the curly one.
 • Ellipsis: Use to indicate omission, hesitating speech, or trailing thoughts, mainly in informal writing or push notifications. Do not overuse. If the ellipsis is in the middle of a sentence, do not capitalize the following word; if at the end, capitalize the next word.
 • Ampersands: Do not use unless part of a company or brand name.
3. Capitalisation
 • In Italian, only capitalize the first letter of the first word in titles.
 • Month names and days of the week are lowercase, except for specific events or dates (e.g., il Venerdì santo, il Primo Maggio).
4. Euphonic d
 • Use "euphonic d" (ad, ed) only between two identical vowels (e.g., ad Atene, ed ecco).
 • Exceptions: Use in common phrases where omission would be unusual (e.g., ad esempio, ad eccezione di).
 • Do not use "od" in written Italian.
5. Placeholders
 • Do not translate, edit, or delete placeholders.
 • Placeholders may change position/order in the sentence; ensure correct article or preposition before them.
 • Example: Promozione valida fino al <date>. > Promozione valida fino al giorno <date>.
 • If a placeholder is replaced by a number starting with a vowel, use "all'" with an apostrophe. Adjust the sentence to avoid mistakes.
 • Pay attention to spaces next to placeholders.
6. Inadequate and Regional Words/Expressions
 • Avoid phrases inappropriate for Skyscanner’s context, especially those related to flights such as "Sconti in picchiata" or "Prezzi in caduta libera".
 • Avoid regional and slang expressions.
7. Character Limits
 • Adhere to character limits as indicated in the segment description or as required by layout constraints (e.g., push notifications, narrow spaces).
 • Use a character counter to ensure compliance.
8. Active and Passive Voice
 • Prefer active voice for clarity and directness.
 • Avoid passive constructions that obscure the subject.
 • Example: La prenotazione è stata cancellata. > Abbiamo cancellato la prenotazione.
9. Numbers
 • Use numerals for age, quantity, prices, discounts, and important information.
 • Do not use the number 1 to replace the indefinite article “un/uno” in discursive texts.
 • For numbers with more than three digits, use a dot as a thousand separator (except for years) and a comma as a decimal separator.
10. Currencies
 • Place the currency sign after the figure, separated by a space.
 • Example: 80,99 €
11. Time
 • Use the 24-hour clock system, separating hours and minutes with a colon (e.g., 23:20).
 • For durations, use the format: 5h 30min.
12. Repetitions
 • Avoid unnecessary repetitions, as they are considered style errors in Italian.
 • Repetitions are acceptable in formal texts (terms, regulations, contracts, legal content).
 • Example of style error: Se sbadatamente utilizziamo eccessivamente degli avverbi di modo, rileggendo ci renderemo conto immediatamente che la frase non suona perfettamente! :)
 • Also avoid cacophonies and redundant sentences.
13. Inclusive Language
 • Use neutral words and phrases to promote gender equality.
 • Avoid gendered pronouns and categorizations when possible.
 • Example: Clicca qui se sei interessato a questo volo. > Clicca qui se ti interessa questo volo.
14. Call to Actions (CTAs)
 • CTAs must be clear and concise.
 • Place CTAs at the beginning of a sentence or highlight them for visibility.
15. Translation Memory
 • Review translation memory suggestions critically; do not rely on them blindly.
 • Improve or correct past translations as needed.
16. Use of Anglicisms
 • Avoid anglicisms if a widely accepted Italian equivalent exists.
17. Addressing Users
 • Use the informal "tu" for all website content and communications, including those addressed to all users.
 • Use impersonal constructions only in terms, conditions, and policies.
