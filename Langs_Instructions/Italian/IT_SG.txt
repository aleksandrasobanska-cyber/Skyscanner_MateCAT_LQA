# Skyscanner Italian (IT) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- **Catchy but polite**, **straightforward but not aggressive**
- Focus on the **customer's perspective** — what they receive and experience
- Use **informal "tu" form** for all direct communication with users
- Informal yet **respectful**: avoid bureaucratic or overly formal language
- Prioritize **clear, direct, and natural phrasing** that feels human and engaging
- **Exception:** Legal content (terms, conditions, policies) uses impersonal construction
- Prefer **active voice** — clearer and more direct than passive
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (keep in English)

### 1.2. Punctuation
| Mark | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Period (.) | End of sentences; always **outside** quotation marks |
| Comma (,) | Between clauses; can replace hyphens |
| Semicolon (;) | Only in long, complex sentences — prefer simplification |
| Exclamation/Question mark | **Never more than one** |
| Quotation marks (" ") | Double straight quotes; dialogue punctuation **inside**, period **outside** |
| Apostrophe (') | Use **straight**, not curly; don't confuse with accent |
| Ellipsis (…) | Use sparingly; capital after only if replaces end of sentence |
| Parentheses () | Can replace hyphens; avoid in email subject lines |
| Ampersand (&) | Only for company/brand names — otherwise use "e" |
| Hyphen (-) | Replace with parentheses or commas |

### 1.3. Capitalization
- Use **sentence-style capitalization** (Italian standard)
- **Days and months lowercase:** lunedì, gennaio, febbraio
- **Exception:** Specific events/dates capitalized: il Venerdì santo, il Primo Maggio
- Proper nouns capitalized as standard

### 1.4. Numbers & Currencies
- Write numbers as **numerals**, not words (for age, quantity, prices, discounts)
- **Don't use "1"** to replace indefinite article "un/uno" in discursive text
- **Thousand separator:** dot (1.000) — except for years
- **Decimal separator:** comma (80,99)
- **Currency format:** number + space + symbol: **80,99 €**

### 1.5. Time & Duration
- Use **24-hour clock system**
- **Separator:** colon (23:20)
- **Duration format:** 5h 30min

### 1.6. Euphonic "d"
- Use **only between identical vowels:** ad Atene, ed ecco, od oggi
- **Established exceptions:** ad esempio, ad eccezione di
- **Never use "od"** in written Italian (inappropriate for context)

### 1.7. Gender & Inclusive Language
- Use **gender-neutral words and phrases** when possible
- **Avoid gendered pronouns** and categorizations when meaning is preserved
- Restructure to avoid gender markers:
  - ❌ "Clicca qui se sei interessato a questo volo"
  - ✅ "Clicca qui se ti interessa questo volo"

### 1.8. Placeholder Handling
- **Never translate, edit, or delete placeholders**
- Placeholders may change position within sentence
- **Pay close attention to articles/prepositions** before placeholders
- Add generic words to handle article agreement issues:
  - ❌ "Promozione valida fino al {date}"
  - ✅ "Promozione valida fino al giorno {date}"
- Watch for spaces adjacent to placeholders

### 1.9. Style & Expression
- **Avoid repetitions** — considered style errors in Italian (unlike English)
- **Avoid cacophonies** and redundant sentences
- Repetitions allowed in formal/legal texts
- **Avoid context-inappropriate metaphors:** no flight-related negative phrases
  - ❌ "Sconti in picchiata" / "Prezzi in caduta libera"
- **Avoid regional and slang expressions**
- **Avoid anglicisms** if widespread Italian equivalent exists

### 1.10. Call to Actions (CTAs)
- Must be **clear and concise**
- **Place at beginning** of sentence or highlight
- Use **imperative form** for engaging actions: "Scopri ora", "Prenota subito"

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Placeholder & Article Handling Tolerance

Italian articles must agree with the following word, making placeholder handling challenging. **Accept creative workarounds.**

#### 2.1.1. Acceptable Workarounds for Placeholders

| Source | Acceptable Italian Approaches |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `Valid until {date}` | `Valida fino al giorno {date}` OR `Valida fino a: {date}` |
| `Flights to {city}` | `Voli per la città di {city}` OR `Voli verso {city}` |
| `{number} results found` | `Risultati trovati: {number}` OR `Numero di risultati: {number}` |
| `Welcome, {username}!` | `Ciao {username}!` OR `Benvenuto/a, {username}!` |
| `Departing from {airport}` | `Partenza da: {airport}` OR `Partenza dall'aeroporto di {airport}` |

**Do NOT flag** if the translator:
- Adds generic nouns (giorno, città, aeroporto) to handle article agreement
- Uses colon structure to avoid article issues
- Restructures to place placeholder after preposition that works universally
- Changes word order to accommodate placeholder position

#### 2.1.2. Do NOT Flag as "Grammar Error"
- Creative restructuring to handle article/preposition agreement
- Addition of generic nouns before placeholders
- Use of colon or "di" structures

**Only flag** if the structure would be **grammatically incorrect with plausible placeholder values**.

---

### 2.2. Gender Agreement Tolerance

Gender agreement with unknown placeholder content is inherently challenging.

#### 2.2.1. Acceptable Gender Strategies

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Dual gender markers | Benvenuto/a, interessato/a |
| Gender-neutral restructuring | "se ti interessa" instead of "se sei interessato/a" |
| Impersonal constructions | Using impersonal "si" forms |
| Omitting gendered elements | When meaning is preserved |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Use of slash for dual gender (o/a endings)
- Restructuring that avoids the need for gender agreement
- Impersonal constructions used to avoid gender markers
- Masculine default when gender-neutral options would be awkward

**Only flag** if gender is **explicitly specified** in context and translation contradicts it.

---

### 2.3. Meaning-Based Translation Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly encourages natural Italian that captures attention. **Accept creative, non-literal translation.**

#### 2.3.1. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"
- Restructured sentences that preserve meaning but differ in structure
- Active voice replacing passive (preferred by Style Guide)
- Idiomatic Italian expressions replacing English idioms
- Synonyms used to avoid repetition (required by Style Guide)
- Simplified sentences replacing complex semicolon-heavy structures

#### 2.3.2. Do NOT Flag as "Omission/Addition"
- Articles, pronouns, or connectors adjusted for Italian flow
- Addition of generic nouns for placeholder handling
- Omission of repetitive elements that would sound unnatural in Italian
- Omission of "please" when informal "tu" form is used
- CTAs repositioned to beginning of sentence (as recommended)

**Only flag** if core meaning is changed or lost.

---

### 2.4. Punctuation & Formatting Tolerance

#### 2.4.1. Do NOT Flag
- Hyphens replaced by commas or parentheses (preferred in Italian)
- Ampersand replaced by "e" (required unless brand name)
- Semicolon replaced by period with sentence simplification
- Reduced exclamation marks (single instead of multiple)
- Period placement outside quotation marks (Italian standard)
- Ellipsis usage variations within acceptable range

#### 2.4.2. Only Flag If
- Multiple exclamation or question marks used
- Accent confused with apostrophe (or vice versa)
- Curly apostrophe used instead of straight
- Punctuation creates meaning confusion
- Question mark missing from questions

---

### 2.5. Capitalization Tolerance

#### 2.5.1. Do NOT Flag
- Sentence-style capitalization where source uses title-style
- Days of week in lowercase (lunedì, martedì)
- Month names in lowercase (gennaio, febbraio)
- Different capitalization choices within Italian norms

#### 2.5.2. Only Flag If
- Proper nouns not capitalized
- Specific event/date names not capitalized (Venerdì santo, Primo Maggio)
- Lowercase at sentence start

---

### 2.6. Euphonic "d" Tolerance

#### 2.6.1. Do NOT Flag
- Euphonic "d" used between identical vowels (ad Atene, ed ecco)
- Established phrases with euphonic "d" (ad esempio, ad eccezione di)
- Euphonic "d" omitted in non-standard combinations (e Alberto, a Udine)
- Minor variations in euphonic "d" usage within acceptable range

#### 2.6.2. Only Flag If
- "od" used (inappropriate in written Italian)
- Euphonic "d" clearly misused creating awkward phrasing
- Absence creates pronunciation difficulty with identical vowels

---

### 2.7. Number & Currency Tolerance

#### 2.7.1. Do NOT Flag
- Numbers written as numerals (preferred)
- Dot used as thousand separator
- Comma used as decimal separator
- Currency symbol after number with space (80,99 €)
- 24-hour time format with colon

- "1" used instead of "un/uno" article in discursive text
- Currency format inverted (€80,99 instead of 80,99 €)

---

### 2.8. Terminology & Synonym Tolerance

| English | Acceptable Italian Options |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Flight | volo, voli |
| Book | prenota, effettua una prenotazione, riserva |

| Hotel | hotel, albergo, struttura |
| Discover | scopri, esplora |
| View | visualizza, vedi, guarda |

- Brand/product names in English
- Industry-standard English terms

#### 2.11.2. Only Flag If
- Anglicism used when widespread Italian equivalent exists and is appropriate
- Anglicism creates comprehension issues for general audience
- Inconsistent use (switching between English and Italian for same term)

---

### 2.12. Space Constraint Tolerance

Italian translations may need condensing for UI elements. **Accept economical renditions when space is limited.**

#### 2.12.1. Do NOT Flag
- Shorter synonyms used when space is limited
- Contextually obvious words omitted
- Abbreviated forms when character limits apply
- Condensed phrasing that preserves meaning

**Only flag** if omission causes confusion or meaning loss.

---

### 2.13. Severity Calibration

| Severity | Apply When |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Placeholder corruption, complete meaning inversion, broken tags, wrong language |
| **Major** | Core meaning changed, factual errors, grammatical errors that impede understanding, inappropriate register in legal content |
| **Minor** | Style preferences, minor inconsistencies within acceptable range, euphonic "d" variations |

---

### 2.14. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is this a **creative restructuring** to handle Italian grammar constraints (articles, gender, placeholders)?
2. ☐ Would the translation work with **plausible placeholder values**?
3. ☐ Is the **core meaning preserved** despite structural changes?
4. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
5. ☐ Would a native Italian speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different)?
6. ☐ Is a **synonym used to avoid repetition** (as required by Style Guide)?
7. ☐ Is the **register appropriate** for the content type (informal for user content, impersonal for legal)?
8. ☐ Are punctuation choices **within Italian norms** (not English norms)?

**If meaning is preserved AND the structure handles Italian language requirements → DO NOT FLAG**
