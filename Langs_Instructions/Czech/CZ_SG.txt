# Skyscanner Czech (CS) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use a **friendly, conversational tone** — write as if talking to a friend
- **Be creative** — forget word-for-word translation completely
- Glossary and TM are helpers, **not masters** — add words/phrases if it sounds more natural
- Be **specific, interesting, and honest**
- Use common sense — think about what you would like to see when using the app
- Brand name: **Skyscanner** (keep in English)

### 1.2. Punctuation Overview
Czech punctuation rules are complex. Key guidelines:

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Full stops | Titles/non-verbal phrases: usually NO full stop. Verbal sentences: YES |
| Comma | Context-dependent in lists; follow Czech grammar rules |
| Semicolon | **Avoid** — split into two sentences or merge clauses instead |
| Quotation marks | Use Czech marks: „ " (Alt+0132 / Alt+0147) |
| Three dots | Use three separate dots (...) NOT ellipsis symbol (…) |

### 1.3. Hyphen (-) vs. Dash (–)
| Symbol | Usage | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Hyphen (-) | Within word structures (morphological) | e-mail, Rakousko-Uhersko |
| Dash (–) | Separating words/sentence chunks (syntactic) | Alt+0150 |

### 1.4. Forward Slash Usage
Used for feminine/masculine morphology:

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Single words | No spaces | e-mail/mobil |
| Multi-word phrases | Spaces around slash | e-mailová adresa / mobil |
| Gender endings | Forward slash (NOT brackets) | rezervoval/a ✓ (NOT rezervoval(a) ✗) |

### 1.5. Non-Breaking Spaces
**Required in these cases:**
- Between number and unit of measure: `10 km`
- Before percentage sign: `15 %`
- After one-letter prepositions: `v, s, z, k, o, u, a, i`

**Important:** After one-letter prepositions is **extremely important** to prevent line breaks.

**Do NOT use HTML codes** like `&nbsp;`

### 1.6. Capitalisation
- **Do NOT follow English capitalisation**
- Use **Czech sentence case** (only first letter of sentence/title uppercase)
- Follow Czech grammar rules strictly

| English | Czech |
|---------|-------|
| Send or Request Money | Zaslat nebo požádat o peníze |
| Book Your Flight | Rezervujte si let |

### 1.7. Word Order (Functional Sentence Perspective)
- Czech word order significantly impacts meaning emphasis
- Use appropriate word order to stress the intended message
- Different from English fixed word order

### 1.8. Anglicisms
- **Use sparingly** — only if universally understood
- Consider older generations who may not be familiar with English
- Prefer Czech equivalents when available

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

### 2.12. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is this a **creative restructuring** that sounds natural in Czech?
2. ☐ Is the **word order** appropriate for Czech functional sentence perspective?
3. ☐ Does the punctuation follow **Czech rules** (not English)?
4. ☐ Is the **capitalisation** correct for Czech (sentence case, not title case)?
5. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
6. ☐ Would a native Czech speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different from source)?

**If meaning is preserved AND the translation follows Czech conventions → DO NOT FLAG**
