# Skyscanner Spanish Spain (es-ES) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use **Castilian Spanish (Spain)** — warm, conversational, friendly
- Address users with **informal "tú"** (not formal "usted")
- **Exception:** Legal texts use formal "usted"
- Use **"nosotros/nos/nuestro"** to refer to Skyscanner
- Write as if talking to a friend — clear, direct, inspiring
- **Creativity is key:** Feel free to transcreate; don't follow English structure blindly
- **Avoid word repetition:** Use synonyms where possible
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (do not translate)

### 1.2. Punctuation

| Mark | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Exclamation marks (¡!) | Use prudently — can sound overexcited in Spanish |
| Quotation marks | Use angular «» instead of English "" |
| Hyphens | Unusual in Spanish — avoid hyphenated words |
| Full stops | NO full stops for: buttons, menus, headers, titles |
| Commas | Follow Spanish rules, not English source |

- **Free to change punctuation** and merge sentences for readability
- **Bulleted lists:** Follow Spanish punctuation/capitalization conventions

### 1.3. Capitalization

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Titles and buttons | Do NOT capitalize every word (unlike English) |
| Months and days | Lowercase (enero, lunes) unless starting sentence |
| After colon | Usually lowercase |

**Exceptions for capital after colon:**
- After greeting in email/letter
- After "Nota:", "Aviso:", "Urgente:"
- When following text is a quote

### 1.4. Non-breaking Spaces

Use non-breaking spaces in these contexts:

| Context | Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Dates | 18 de marzo de 2020 | 18de marzo de2020 |
| Currency | 20 € | 20€ |
| Percentage | 10 % | 10% |

### 1.5. Numbers

| Context | Format |
|---------|--------|
| 0–10 in text | Written form preferred (dos, cinco) — but flexible |
| 4-digit numbers | No separator (1000, 2500) |
| 5+ digit numbers | Non-breaking space separator (10 000, 100 000) |
| Decimals | Comma (3,5) |
| Prices/percentages | Numerals always acceptable |

### 1.6. Dates & Time

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|

| Time | 24-hour with colon (14:00) |
| Time with "h" | Optional: 14:00 or 14:00 h (space before h) |
| Time placeholders | Use "las" (covers all times except 01:00) |

### 1.7. Active Voice
- **Prefer active voice** over passive voice
  - ✓ "El hotel ha cancelado tu reserva."
  - ✗ "Tu reserva ha sido cancelada por el hotel."

### 1.8. Anglicisms
- **Avoid** English words when Spanish equivalent exists
- **Exceptions:** Some terms allowed for Social Media/Marketing (case-by-case)

- Use inclusive constructions where natural

### 1.10. Names & Geo-terms
- **Skyscanner:** Keep in English (never translate)

- **URLs:** No spaces, lowercase, no special characters (ñ → n, á → a)

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Creative Translation Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly encourages **transcreation and creative adaptation**.

#### 2.1.1. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"
- Restructured sentences that preserve meaning
- Different wording that sounds more natural in Spanish
- Merged or split sentences for better readability
- Changed sentence structure from English source
- Idiomatic Spanish expressions replacing literal translations
- Synonym use to avoid word repetition

#### 2.1.2. Do NOT Flag as "Omission/Addition"
- Words added for natural Spanish flow
- Words omitted that are redundant in Spanish
- Restructuring that conveys same message differently
- Cultural adaptations that preserve intent

**Only flag** if core meaning is changed or lost.

---

### 2.2. Punctuation Tolerance

The Style Guide states translators are **free to change punctuation**.

#### 2.2.1. Acceptable Quotation Mark Variations

| Style | Accept? |
|-------|---------|

---

### 2.3. Capitalization Tolerance

Spanish capitalization differs significantly from English.

#### 2.3.1. Do NOT Flag

- Clear capitalization error by Spanish standards

---

### 2.4. Number & Date Format Tolerance

#### 2.4.1. Do NOT Flag

---

### 2.5. Gender Agreement Tolerance

#### 2.5.1. Acceptable Gender Strategies

| Inclusive phrasing | Natural-sounding alternatives |

**Do NOT flag:**

---

### 2.7. Active Voice Tolerance

#### 2.7.1. Do NOT Flag
- Active voice constructions (preferred)

- Restructuring from passive to active

#### 2.7.2. Only Flag If
- Awkward passive construction when active would be clearly better

---

### 2.8. Terminology & Synonym Tolerance

The Style Guide encourages **synonym use to avoid repetition**.

---

### 2.10. Non-breaking Space Tolerance

#### 2.10.1. Do NOT Flag

**Only flag** if article usage creates clear grammatical error.

---

### 2.12. Severity Calibration

|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Placeholder corruption, complete meaning inversion, broken tags, wrong currency |

### 2.13. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is this a **creative adaptation** that sounds natural in Spanish?
2. ☐ Is the **informal "tú" register** consistently used (except legal)?
3. ☐ Does **capitalization** follow Spanish rules (not English)?
4. ☐ Is the **core meaning preserved** despite structural changes?
5. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
6. ☐ Would a native Spain Spanish speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different)?
7. ☐ Is **synonym variation** being used appropriately to avoid repetition?
8. ☐ Are **quotation marks** functional even if not angular style?

**If meaning is preserved AND the structure sounds natural in Spanish → DO NOT FLAG**
