# Skyscanner Croatian (HR) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use a **friendly, personal, conversational tone** — write as if talking to a friend
- Be **specific, interesting, and honest** — provide useful, concrete information
- Say what you mean clearly and naturally
- Use **exclamation marks sparingly**
- Brand name: **Skyscanner** (keep in English)

### 1.2. Form of Address (Translation of "you")
Croatian distinguishes between formal/informal and singular/plural address:

| Context | Form | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Skyscanner → User (addressing, instructing, prompting) | **2nd person plural "vi"** | Istražite, Uštedite, Pratite cijene |
| User → System (user commands, telling system what to do) | **2nd person singular "ti"** | Istraži sve, Pokaži mi |

**Note:** Although friendly, the plural "vi" form is used for politeness when Skyscanner addresses users.

### 1.3. Dates & Time
| Element | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Date (numeric) | DD. MM. YYYY. | 12. 4. 2019. |
| Date (with month name) | DD. month YYYY. | 12. travnja 2019. |
| Date (abbreviated) | DD. mon YY. | 12. ožu 20. |
| Day abbreviations | No periods | pon, uto, sri, čet, pet, sub, ned |
| Month abbreviations | No periods | sij, velj, ožu, tra, svi, lip, srp, kol, ruj, lis, stu, pro |
| Time | 24-hour with colon | 9:00 – 16:00 |

**Important:** Days, months, and seasons are **NOT capitalised** in Croatian.

### 1.4. Numbers & Currencies
| Element | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Decimal separator | Comma | 108,99 |
| Thousand separator | Point (for 1000+) | 1.000.000,00 |
| Currency position | After number with non-breaking space | 602 kn, 1.525 € |
| Numbers 1-10 | Flexible (spelled out OR numeric) | 7 noćenja OR sedam noćenja |

### 1.5. Units of Measure
- **Always localise** to metric units used in Croatia
- When source uses **imperial units**, provide both: "5 in/13 cm"
- Use **non-breaking space** before: units, %, currency symbols, month/year abbreviations

### 1.6. Punctuation & Dashes
| Element | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Hyphen (-) | Compound nouns, acronym inflection | web-mjesto, na USB-u |
| N dash (–) | Ranges, lists (with non-breaking spaces) | 5 – 6 pm, 2018. – 2029. |
| Em dash (—) | **NOT used** in Croatian | — |
| Pause in sentence | Use colon, semi-colon, or rephrase | Do NOT use dashes |

### 1.7. Addresses & Toponyms
- **Localise:** City names, country names
- **Keep as source:** Street names, building numbers, postal codes
- Example: "London, United Kingdom" → "London, Ujedinjena Kraljevina"

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Form of Address Tolerance

The vi/ti distinction follows specific contextual rules, not rigid formality rules.

#### 2.1.1. Do NOT Flag
- "Vi" form when Skyscanner addresses, instructs, or prompts the user
- "Ti" form for user-initiated commands or system instructions
- Consistent use of either form within appropriate context
- Imperative forms matching the correct register (Istražite vs. Istraži)

#### 2.1.2. Only Flag If
- "Ti" used where "vi" is required (Skyscanner → user communication)
- "Vi" used where "ti" is required (user command contexts)
- Inconsistent mixing within the same context/string
- Register mismatch creates confusion or inappropriate tone

---

### 2.2. Date & Time Format Tolerance

#### 2.2.1. Do NOT Flag
- Minor spacing variations around periods in dates
- Abbreviated month forms (ožu, tra) vs. full month names (ožujka, travnja)
- 24-hour time format variations (9:00 vs. 09:00)
- Standard Croatian abbreviations for days/months

- Correct use of comma for decimals and point for thousands

#### 2.3.2. Only Flag If
- Wrong decimal separator (point instead of comma)
- Wrong thousand separator (comma instead of point)
- Currency symbol in wrong position (before number when should be after)
- Format creates confusion or is clearly incorrect

---

### 2.4. Punctuation & Dash Tolerance

#### 2.4.1. Do NOT Flag
- Correct use of hyphen (-) for compounds and acronym inflection
- N dash (–) used for ranges with appropriate spacing
- Colons or semi-colons used instead of dashes for pauses
- Minor variations in spacing around dashes in ranges

#### 2.4.2. Only Flag If
- Em dash (—) used (not standard in Croatian)
- Dashes used to mark pauses instead of colons/semi-colons
- Hyphen vs. n dash confusion that affects meaning
- Missing or incorrect punctuation that creates ambiguity

---

### 2.5. Unit of Measure Tolerance

#### 2.5.1. Do NOT Flag
- Metric units used (correct for Croatian market)
- Both imperial and metric provided when source was imperial
- Rounded conversions to whole numbers
- Non-breaking space before units (even if not visually verifiable)

#### 2.5.2. Only Flag If
- Imperial units used without metric equivalent
- Conversion is mathematically incorrect
- Wrong unit type entirely (weight instead of distance, etc.)

---

### 2.6. Meaning-Based Translation Tolerance

The Style Guide encourages natural, clear communication over literal translation.

#### 2.6.1. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"

- Sentence case in titles/headings
- Proper nouns following Croatian conventions

#### 2.7.2. Only Flag If
- Days, months, or seasons incorrectly capitalised
- Proper nouns incorrectly lowercased

---

### 2.8. Address & Toponym Tolerance

#### 2.8.1. Do NOT Flag

**Do NOT flag** reasonable synonym choices that preserve meaning and fit context.

---

### 2.10. Spacing & Non-Breaking Space Tolerance

#### 2.10.1. Do NOT Flag
- Non-breaking spaces before units, %, currency (often not visually distinguishable)
- Regular spaces in contexts where non-breaking would be ideal but display is correct
- Minor spacing variations that don't affect readability

#### 2.10.2. Only Flag If
- Missing space entirely between number and unit/currency
- Spacing creates clear visual or functional issues
- Line breaks occur inappropriately within number-unit pairs (if verifiable)

---

### 2.11. Severity Calibration

| Severity | Apply When |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Placeholder corruption, complete meaning inversion, broken tags, functional errors |
| **Major** | Core meaning changed, factual errors, wrong register (ti/vi misuse in clear context), inappropriate tone |
| **Minor** | Style preferences within acceptable range, minor inconsistencies, formatting preferences |
| **Do Not Flag** | Issues covered by tolerance rules 2.1–2.10 |

---

### 2.12. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is the **vi/ti usage** appropriate for the specific context (Skyscanner→user vs. user→system)?
2. ☐ Are **dates, numbers, currencies** in acceptable Croatian format?
3. ☐ Is this a **natural Croatian expression** rather than a literal translation issue?
4. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
5. ☐ Would a native Croatian speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different from source)?
6. ☐ Is the flagged issue about **literal fidelity** rather than actual error?

**If meaning is preserved AND the translation follows Croatian conventions → DO NOT FLAG**
