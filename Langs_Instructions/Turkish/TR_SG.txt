# Skyscanner Turkish (TR) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use **Turkish** — friendly but polite, not bureaucratic
- Address users with **formal "siz"** (not informal "sen")
- **Friendly but formal:** Keep it bold, helpful, joyful, straightforward
- Write as if talking to a friend — but with polite register
- **Be brief:** Simplify sentences, remove redundant words, use shorter words
- **Active voice preferred**
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (do not translate)

### 1.2. Addressing Users

| Approach | Form |
|----------|------|
| Address form | Formal "siz" |
| Style | Friendly but polite, NOT bureaucratic |
| Verb conjugations | 2nd person plural (-siniz, -nız, etc.) |

#### Salutations with Names
| Source | ✓ Correct | ✗ Incorrect |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Dear [first_name] | Merhaba [first_name] | Sayın [first_name] |
| Hi [first_name] | Merhaba [first_name] | Sayın [first_name] |

**Note:** "Sayın" + first name sounds awkward in Turkish; use "Merhaba" instead.

### 1.3. Style Guidelines
- **Simplify sentences** — boil down to essence, recreate in simplest way
- **Be brief** — break up long sentences, remove excess words
- **Use shorter words** when longer alternatives exist
- **Use active voice** as much as possible
- **Be interesting** but not over-enthusiastic
- **Avoid too many exclamation marks**
- **Avoid abbreviations**, jargon, and business speak
- **Less is better** for repetitions and redundant words

### 1.4. Accents (Circumflex)
Use accents to differentiate words with similar spellings:

| With Accent | Without Accent |
|-------------|----------------|
| hâlâ (still) | hala (aunt) |
| âdet (custom) | adet (number/piece) |
| hâl (condition) | hal (hall) |

### 1.5. Punctuation

| Mark | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Quotation marks | Double straight " " without spaces |
| Nested quotes | Single straight ' ' |
| Exclamation marks | Use sparingly |
| Period | Follows TDK rules |

- Follow **TDK (Türk Dil Kurumu)** guidance for punctuation, capitalization, numbers

### 1.6. Numbers & Dates (Turkish Conventions)

| Context | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Thousands separator | Period (1.000, 10.000) |
| Decimal separator | Comma (3,5) |
| Date format | DD.MM.YYYY or D Ayname YYYY |
| Time format | 24-hour (14:30 or 14.30) |
| Currency | TRY or TL after number |

### 1.7. Anglicisms
- **Avoid** niche English terms and jargon
- **Acceptable:** Widely known English terms used in Turkish
- **Prefer Turkish** translation if it exists
- **Transcreate** with simple, clear Turkish sentence structures

### 1.8. Ampersands
- Replace with **"ve"** or **"ile"**
- **Keep & in brand names** (Dolce & Gabbana)

### 1.9. Suffix Rules (Turkish Agglutination)
- Turkish uses suffixes attached to words
- Observe **vowel harmony** (front/back, rounded/unrounded)
- Use **apostrophe** before suffixes on proper nouns: Skyscanner'da, İstanbul'a
- **Buffer consonants** where needed (y, n, s, ş)

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Formal Address ("Siz") Tolerance

Turkish uses formal "siz" but maintains friendly tone.

| Dear Customer | Sayın Müşterimiz | - |

### 2.13. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is the **formal "siz" address** consistently used (but friendly tone)?
2. ☐ Are **salutations** handled correctly ("Merhaba" with first names)?
3. ☐ Is **vowel harmony** correctly applied in suffixes?
4. ☐ Is the translation **appropriately brief** as Style Guide requires?
5. ☐ Are **accents** used correctly where needed for disambiguation?
6. ☐ Is the **core meaning preserved** despite simplification?
7. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
8. ☐ Would a native Turkish speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different)?
9. ☐ Is **Turkish preferred** over anglicism where equivalent exists?

**If meaning is preserved AND the structure sounds natural in Turkish → DO NOT FLAG**
