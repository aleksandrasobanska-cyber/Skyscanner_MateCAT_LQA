# Skyscanner Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) – LQA Calibration & Style Guide

## 1. Style Guide Summary

### 1.1. Voice & Tone
- Use **Brazilian Portuguese** — warm, conversational, friendly, not formal or stiff
- Address users with **informal singular "você"** (not "tu" or "vós")
- Write as if talking to a friend — simple, direct, helpful
- **Put the traveller first:** Focus on benefits and advice for the user
- **Creativity is key:** Translate meaning, not words; make it sound naturally Brazilian
- Skyscanner = **Skyscanner** (keep in English, do not translate)

### 1.2. Punctuation

| Mark | Usage |
|------|-------|
| Ampersand (&) | Translate as "e" unless part of a brand name (Dolce & Gabbana) |
| Comma (,) | Use sparingly; avoid convoluted sentences |
| Colon (:) | Do not capitalize word after colon on same line |
| Semicolon (;) | Use sparingly; prefer simpler sentence structures |
| Exclamation (!) | Use sparingly — English is more playful; remove if it sounds over-excited in Portuguese |
| Quotation marks | Use double quotes ("") first; straight preferred over curly, but both acceptable |
| Apostrophe | Prefer straight (') over curly ('), but both acceptable |
| Slash (/) | **No spaces** before or after (US$ 100/noite, not US$ 100 / noite) |

- **Hyphens (-):** Follow "Acordo Ortográfico da Língua Portuguesa" rules
- **En dashes (–):** Avoid; use commas, parentheses, or em dashes instead
- **Em dashes (—):** Acceptable for parenthetical clauses

### 1.3. Numbers & Dates

| Context | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Numbers 0–10 in text | Write out (dois, cinco, dez) |
| Numbers 11–999 | Use numerals (12, 350) |
| 1,000+ (round/approximate) | Cardinal + word (3 mil, 20 milhões); use "mil" not "1 mil" |
| 1,000+ (exact) | Use numerals with period separator (1.234, 18.318) |
| Full date | domingo, 13 de janeiro de 2020 |
| First day of month | Use ordinal: 1º de fevereiro de 2020 |
| Abbreviated date | DD/M/YYYY, no leading zeros (8/4/2020) |
| Time | 24-hour format with "h" (9h, 13h30, 23h59) |

### 1.4. Currencies
- **Space** between symbol and value: `R$ 100` (not `R$100`)
- Use **US$** for American dollars (not USD)
- Currency symbol **before** value

### 1.5. Addressing Users – "Você"
- Always use **"você"** for "you" (not "tu" or "vós")
- Use **"seu/seus/sua/suas"** for possessives (not "teu/teus")
- When subject is repeated, **omit excess subjects** for readability
  - ✓ "Você receberá um reembolso se reservar agora."
  - ✗ "Você receberá um reembolso se você reservar agora."

### 1.6. Active Voice
- **Prefer active voice** over passive voice
  - ✓ "O hotel cancelou sua reserva."
  - ✗ "Sua reserva foi cancelada pelo hotel."

### 1.7. Names & Toponyms
- **Skyscanner:** Keep in English (never translate)
- **Brand/company names:** Keep in English unless established Portuguese name exists
- **Country names:** Follow IBGE or Google Maps spellings
- **Organization names:** Research official Brazilian names; if none exists, keep in English
- **URLs:** Always keep in English; no spaces, lowercase, no special characters (é → e)

### 1.8. Units of Measure
- Follow **INMETRO** guidelines (International System of Units)

## 2. LQA CALIBRATION: FALSE POSITIVE PREVENTION

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what the evaluator must **ACCEPT**. Flagging these creates unnecessary validation burden.

---

### 2.1. Subject Omission Tolerance

Portuguese naturally omits repeated subjects. **Accept subject omission when meaning is clear.**

#### 2.1.1. Acceptable Subject Handling

| Source | Acceptable Portuguese |
|--------|----------------------|
| `If you book now, you will receive...` | `Se reservar agora, você receberá...` (second "you" omitted) |
| `You can find your booking in your account` | `Você pode encontrar sua reserva na sua conta` OR `Encontre sua reserva na sua conta` |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Omission of repeated subjects/pronouns when meaning is preserved
- Implicit subjects when verb conjugation makes subject clear
- Restructuring that reduces redundancy

---

### 2.2. Gender Agreement Tolerance

Portuguese has grammatical gender. For unknown-gender placeholders, **accept reasonable defaults.**

#### 2.2.1. Acceptable Gender Strategies

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Masculine default for unknown users | `Bem-vindo, {{user}}!` |
| Gender-neutral restructuring | `Boas-vindas, {{user}}!` instead of gendered greeting |
| Using inclusive forms where natural | `Você está satisfeito(a)?` or `Está satisfeito?` |

**Do NOT flag:**
- Masculine default for unknown-gender placeholders
- Restructuring to avoid gender specification
- Use of (a) or (o/a) suffixes for inclusivity

**Only flag** if gender is **explicitly specified** in context and translation contradicts it.

---

### 2.3. Meaning-Based Translation Tolerance

The Style Guide explicitly encourages creative, non-literal translation that sounds naturally Brazilian.

#### 2.3.1. Do NOT Flag as "Mistranslation"
- Restructured sentences that preserve meaning
- Idiomatic adaptations appropriate for Brazilian Portuguese
- Simplification of complex English structures
- Natural Portuguese word order (which may differ from English)

#### 2.3.2. Do NOT Flag as "Omission/Addition"
- Removal of excessive exclamation marks (English → Portuguese tone adjustment)
- Adjustment of articles, pronouns, or connectors for natural flow
- Implicit elements when clear from context
- Addition of articles required in Portuguese but absent in English

**Only flag** if core meaning is changed or lost.

---

### 2.4. Punctuation & Formatting Tolerance

#### 2.4.1. Do NOT Flag
- Straight vs. curly quotation marks (" " vs. " ")
- Straight vs. curly apostrophes (' vs. ')
- Removal of exclamation marks when they sound unnatural in Portuguese
- Minor variations in comma placement for natural flow
- Use of em dash (—) vs. commas for parenthetical clauses

#### 2.4.2. Only Flag If
- Question becomes statement (? removed from question)
- Punctuation creates meaning confusion
- Spaces around slashes when there should be none (100 / noite → 100/noite)

---

### 2.5. Number & Date Format Tolerance

#### 2.5.1. Do NOT Flag
- Written numbers 0–10 OR numerals, unless inconsistent within same text
- Variations in large number formatting (3 mil vs. 3.000) for approximate values
- Minor variations in date format within acceptable Brazilian conventions

#### 2.5.2. Only Flag If
- Date format is clearly incorrect or confusing
- Numbers use wrong decimal/thousands separators (comma vs. period)
- Time format is wrong (AM/PM instead of 24h format with "h")

---

### 2.6. Terminology & Synonym Tolerance

| English | Acceptable Portuguese Options |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Flight | voo |
| Book (verb) | reservar, fazer reserva |
| Search | buscar, pesquisar, procurar |
| Deal | oferta, promoção |
| Trip | viagem, passeio |
| Hotel | hotel |
| Save (money) | economizar, poupar |
| Save (bookmark) | salvar, guardar |
| Traveller | viajante |
| App | aplicativo, app |

**Do NOT flag** reasonable synonym choices unless they change meaning or context makes one clearly wrong.

---

### 2.7. Formality & Register Tolerance

#### 2.7.1. Do NOT Flag
- Conversational contractions and informal expressions appropriate for Skyscanner's tone
- Simplification of formal English phrases into natural Portuguese equivalents
- Use of common Brazilian expressions over literal translations

#### 2.7.2. Examples of Acceptable Tone Adaptation

| Formal/Literal (Avoid) | Natural/Conversational (Accept) |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| "Não hesite em entrar em contato" | "Fale com a gente" |
| "Gostaríamos de informar" | "Queremos avisar" / "A gente quer avisar" |
| "Providenciaremos assistência" | "Vamos ajudar" |

---

### 2.8. Ampersand & Symbol Tolerance

#### 2.8.1. Do NOT Flag
- `&` translated as "e" in general text
- `&` kept in brand names (Dolce & Gabbana)

#### 2.8.2. Only Flag If
- `&` used instead of "e" in regular text (outside brand names)
- Brand name ampersand incorrectly changed to "e"

---

### 2.9. Severity Calibration

| Severity | Apply When |
|----------|------------|
| **Critical** | Placeholder corruption, complete meaning inversion, broken tags, wrong currency format |
| **Major** | Core meaning changed, factual errors, wrong formality level for content type (legal vs. marketing) |
| **Minor** | Style preferences, minor inconsistencies within acceptable range |
| **Do Not Flag** | Issues covered by tolerance rules 2.1–2.8 |

---

### 2.10. Pre-Flag Checklist

Before flagging, verify:

1. ☐ Is this a **natural restructuring** for Brazilian Portuguese flow?
2. ☐ Is the **subject omission** acceptable given verb conjugation clarity?
3. ☐ Is the **core meaning preserved** despite structural changes?
4. ☐ Does the Style Guide **explicitly prohibit** this choice?
5. ☐ Would a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker find this **incorrect** (not just different)?
6. ☐ Is this a **tone adjustment** appropriate for Brazilian vs. English sensibilities?

**If meaning is preserved AND the structure sounds natural in Brazilian Portuguese → DO NOT FLAG**
